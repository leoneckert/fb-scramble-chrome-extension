# Opinions Are My Own - Chrome Extension

The concept behind this project can be found here: [http://leoneckert.com/opinions-are-my-own.html](http://leoneckert.com/opinions-are-my-own.html)

## What is this extension doing?

The idea was to find a way of expressing ourselves on Facebook so that other users can read it, but Facebook's algorithms cannot. <br>The plugin has two functions.<br> 
[1] Scramble a text so that an algorithm that parses large quantities of data will not make sense of it.<br>
[2] Detect text that has been scrambled in such a way on your page and translate it back into actual words.

##The ideal scenario:
- you scramble what you post<br>
- you see the actual content of all posts and comments<br>
- Facebook's algorithm only sees your scrambled version.

##The reality:
The hope is for the "encryption algorithm" (my version is far from sophisticated and based on various rules scrambling char codes) to be good enough to trick a "dumb" algorithm that processes huge amounts of data, looking for keywords and references based on which inferences can be made. I believe this project can succeed in achieving that at least on a small scale. However, I am very aware and so should be you, there is obviously no guarantee and, of course, if Facebook wanted do, they could look at the extension's source code to reveal the actual content and going on doing their business as usual - before it comes to this, however, let's work out new ways of obfuscation and circumvention!
