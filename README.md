# Opinions Are My Own - Chrome Extension

Project site: [http://leoneckert.com/opinions-are-my-own.html](http://leoneckert.com/opinions-are-my-own.html)

## Share opinions with your friends, not with facebook.

The **OAMO Chrome Plugin** has two functions.<br> 

* Scramble a text, rendering it non-sensical to facebook's algorithms.
* Detect such scrambled text on your facebook feed and translate it back into actual words.

<!--##The ideal scenario:
- you scramble what you post<br>
- you see the actual content of all posts and comments<br>
- Facebook's algorithm only sees your scrambled version.

##disclaimer
The hope is for the "encryption algorithm" (my version is far from sophisticated and based on various rules scrambling char codes) to be good enough to trick a "dumb" algorithm that processes huge amounts of data, looking for keywords and references based on which inferences can be made. I believe this project can succeed in achieving that at least on a small scale. However, I am very aware and so should be you, there is obviously no guarantee and, of course, if Facebook wanted do, they could look at the extension's source code to reveal the actual content and going on doing their business as usual - before it comes to this, however, let's work out new ways of obfuscation and circumvention!
